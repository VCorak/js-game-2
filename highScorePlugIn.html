    // If this function runs it will check the current score, compare it ot high score
    // and if it is higher it will replace highscore value in locale storage and
    // in highScoreBoard element with the new value. we only want ot run the code 
    // if current state is higher than currently stored highscore. if there is no stored 
    // highscore it will run as well, bc score will be more than null and any number added to zero
    // is more than null. at the same time zero is not equal to null. if score us higher than highscore
    // currently held in local store object we enter the if statement 
    // and set the new score as highscore so the locale storage set item game1HigScore
    // and set it equal to score variable. Then, I said higscore variable from line 6
    // to the new score from line 10, bc this new score is higher. Displaying it: 
    // highScoreBoard.textContent = 'HIGH SCORE: '+ highscore
